### Exercise 1.3
> Print celsius to **Fahrenheit to Celsius** conversion table
> Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table.  

- [source file](./src/ex_1_3.c)

### Exercise 1.4
> Write a program to print the corresponding **Celsius to Fahrenheit** table.  

- [source file](./src/ex_1_4.c)

### Exercise 1.6
> Verify that the expression `getchar() != EOF` is 0 or 1

- [source file](./src/ex_1_6.c)

### Exercise 1.7
> Write a program to print the value of EOF. 

- [source file](./src/ex_1_7.c)

### Exercise 1.8
> Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines. 

- [source file](./src/ex_1_8.c)

### Exercise 1.9
> Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a
single blank.

- [source file](./src/ex_1_9.c)

### Exercise 1.10
> Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \t, each backspace by \b,
and each backslash by \\. This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way

- [source file](./src/ex_1_10.c)

### Exercise 1.11
> How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs
if there are any? 

> * 1. Most efficient way to test is to use either generated text and give it as input to the program.
> * Including different types of symbols.
> * 2. The input stream that is the most versatile on special characters.


- [source file](./src/ex_1_11.c)

### Exercise 1.12
> Write a program that prints its input one word per line. 

- [source file](./src/ex_1_12.c)

### Exercise 1.13
> Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is easy to draw the
histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.

- [source file](./src/ex_1_13.c)


### Exercise 1.14
> Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters in its input.  

- [source file](./src/ex_1_14.c)

### Exercise 1.15
> Rewrite the temperature conversion program of Section 1.2 to use a function for conversion.

- [source file](./src/ex_1_15.c)

### Exercise 1.16
> Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print the length of arbitrary
long input lines, and as much as possible of the text. 

- [source file](./src/ex_1_16.c)

### Exercise 1.17
> Write a program to print all input lines that are longer than 80 characters. 

- [source file](./src/ex_1_17.c)

### Exercise 1.18
> Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and to delete entirely
blank lines.

- [source file](./src/ex_1_18.c)

<!-- ### Exercise 1.19
> Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character string s. Use it to write a program that
reverses its input a line at a time. 

- [source file](./src/ex_1_19.c) -->
